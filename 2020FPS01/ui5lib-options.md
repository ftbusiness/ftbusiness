# Options for running Fiori Tracker products on targeted UI5 library

Products from Fiori Tracker suite require access to SAP UI5 library. The application was build and tested for SAP UI5 1.52 so it works best with this specific version although it should also work with higher versions.

On systems with Fiori Launchpad configured the default available library will be used.

If default SAP UI5 library is not be found in your system Fiori Tracker products will automatically start using the library provided by SAP on Content Delivery Network (CDN). If the CDN is not accessible and you are not able to set UI5 library locally you can install "uideps" which will provide the library from your local system in a form of BSP. This is also the way to provide a specific version of the library for Fiori Tracker apps in case your default UI5 library version would cause issues.
